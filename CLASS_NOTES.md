## Gemini's take on ACID ðŸŽ‡

**Atomicity**: All operations within a transaction either complete successfully or are entirely rolled back, preventing partial updates

**Consistency**: Transactions move the database from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity and rules.

**Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, appearing to execute in isolation.

**Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive system failures.

_ACID_ properties ensure high data integrity and reliable transactions, crucial for applications like financial systems where data accuracy is paramount.
Common in traditional relational databases (_MySQL_, _PostgreSQL_) and increasingly supported by some _NoSQL_ databases (_MongoDB_, _RavenDB_) for multi-document transactions. Implementing full _ACID_ can add complexity and cost.
